# Priority_Queue

-->Priority Queue which is also referred to as Heap, there are two types of Heaps:-
  1. Min Heap: We can retrieve the Min element from the heap on the go.
  2. Max Heap: We can retrieve the Max element from the heap on the go.
-->It takes logarithmic time to insert and delete the element from Heap.
-->Heaps are useful when there is a dynamic insertion of elements and a requirement for min and max elements at each insertion.
